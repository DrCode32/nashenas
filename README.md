# Nashenas
Nashenas is a anonymous messaging bot for Telegram users, designed for security purposes. It allows users to send encrypted messages to each other without revealing their identities. Nashenas uses hybrid encryption (RSA + AES) similar to TLS, ensuring that messages remain secure and protected against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The goal is to create a safe and enjoyable platform for anonymous communication. The chart below explains the core mechanism of Nashenas in the simplest way:
