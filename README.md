# Nashenas
This is an anonymous chat messenger that encrypts all messages end-to-end (E2E). Indeed, when using this platform to send messages, you are truly secure, and no one other than you and the recipient has access to the message. Currently, the test version of this platform is limited to a few users, and you can only be the sender.
